Followed tutorial by Tech With Tim  at https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/machine-learning-python/introduction/

Learned an intro level amount of how to use a dataset to train and predict an outcome. Got data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

Comments explain code. Played around with different combinations of data to see which delivered the most accurate results. For example, I learned that the second period grade has a big impact on the final result, while other variables such as parent's occupation did not really correleate with the student's grade in the class. I'm sure that cleaning up the dataset to reduce outliers and other combinations of variables would yield a better model, but this was just done as an introduction.
